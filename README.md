# Hello-World

Hi, everyone.

I'm just a fresh graduate who has ideas that he wants to implement(mostly in the field of game development), and decided it's time to join GitGitHub.

I'm a fresh graduate from Bir Hassan Vocational and Technical Education Institute with a Licensed Technician (LT) degree, in Informatics - Software Development.

For now, I've worked with java, C#, CSS3, XML, HTML5, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and MSSQL.
I've learned Java, PHP, XML, HTML, and MySQL during my school years, and C#, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5 and MSSQL during an internship at Makhzoumi Foundation, where I learned how to build proper normalized databases, n-tier applications, MVCs, and how to refactor my code.

Hope we get along.
